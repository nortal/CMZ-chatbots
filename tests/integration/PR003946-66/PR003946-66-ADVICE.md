# PR003946-66 - Test Specification Analysis

## Ticket Information
- **Ticket**: PR003946-66
- **Summary**: Soft-delete semantics enforced
- **Type**: Task
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Test Category**: Integration

## Description
As a user, I want all list and single-fetch endpoints to hide soft-deleted items by default. Scope/Endpoints:
All list and single GET endpoints Acceptance Criteria:
1) Lists exclude softDelete=true. 2) Single fetch of soft-deleted returns 404. 3) (Future) Admin-only includeDeleted=true explicitly includes them.

## Acceptance Criteria
- 1) Lists exclude softDelete=true. 2) Single fetch of soft-deleted returns 404. 3) (Future) Admin-only includeDeleted=true explicitly includes them.

## Technical Analysis

### Component Impact
- Backend API (Flask/Connexion)

### Dependencies
- Backend services running on localhost:8080
- DynamoDB tables accessible with quest-dev-* naming
- Test user accounts (parent1@test.cmz.org, student1@test.cmz.org, etc.)
- Docker environment configured and running

### Test Scenarios Identified
- Valid DELETE removes resource
- Non-existent resource returns 404
- Permission checks for delete operations
- Cascading delete behavior validation

### Success Criteria
- API endpoint responds with correct HTTP status codes
- Response data matches expected schema and format
- Database operations complete successfully
- Error handling works for invalid inputs

### Risk Assessment
- **High**: Delete operations could cause data loss

## Test Strategy
- **Primary Test Type**: Integration Test
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-4 hours

## Notes
- Generated on: 2025-09-13 16:51:38
- Based on systematic analysis of ticket content and CMZ project patterns
- Should be reviewed and refined based on implementation details
