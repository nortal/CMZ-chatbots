# PR003946-120 - Test Specification Analysis

## Ticket Information
- **Ticket**: PR003946-120
- **Summary**: Critical Gap: Validation Tests Pass While Real Functionality Fails
- **Type**: Bug
- **Status**: To Do
- **Test Category**: Integration

## Description
CRITICAL BUG: Current validation tests show passing while actual user workflows fail completely. Examples: Animal config save tests pass but data disappears, controllers return placeholders, API tests pass but persistence fails. Root cause: Tests validate HTTP 200 responses only, not end-to-end workflows. Impact: Broken functionality deployed, false system confidence. Fix: Implement comprehensive E2E workflow tests simulating real user actions through complete persistence.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Acceptance criteria to be derived from summary and description

## Technical Analysis

### Component Impact
- Core business logic

### Dependencies
- Backend services running on localhost:8080
- DynamoDB tables accessible with quest-dev-* naming
- Test user accounts (parent1@test.cmz.org, student1@test.cmz.org, etc.)
- Docker environment configured and running

### Test Scenarios Identified


### Success Criteria
- API endpoint responds with correct HTTP status codes
- Response data matches expected schema and format
- Database operations complete successfully
- Error handling works for invalid inputs

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium**: Production system impact

## Test Strategy
- **Primary Test Type**: Integration Test
- **Complexity**: High
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-4 hours (High complexity)
