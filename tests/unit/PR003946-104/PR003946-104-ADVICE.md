# PR003946-104 - Test Specification Analysis

## Ticket Information
- **Ticket**: PR003946-104
- **Summary**: Environment Configuration Framework
- **Type**: Task
- **Status**: To Do
- **Test Category**: Unit

## Description
**IMPORTANT: Use Sequential Reasoning MCP when implementing this ticket for systematic analysis and planning.**Implement a centralized configuration framework that manages environment-specific settings across development, staging, and production environments.**Key Features:**- Hierarchical configuration system (base → environment-specific → local overrides)- Type-safe configuration loading with validation- Environment variable resolution with fallbacks- Configuration change tracking and versioning**Technical Requirements:**- Support for YAML, JSON, and environment variable sources- Configuration schema validation- Hot-reload capability for non-sensitive settings- Integration with existing Flask/Connexion application structure**Implementation Approach:**- Use Sequential Reasoning MCP to analyze current configuration patterns- Design schema-first approach with comprehensive validation- Implement systematic testing of all configuration scenarios**Acceptance Criteria:**1. Configuration framework loads settings from multiple sources with proper precedence2. All configuration changes are validated against defined schemas3. Environment-specific overrides work correctly for dev/staging/prod4. Configuration loading errors provide clear, actionable feedback5. Framework integrates seamlessly with existing application startup**Story Points:** 5 (Complex system design and implementation)

## Technical Analysis

### Component Impact
- Core business logic

### Dependencies
- Backend services running on localhost:8080
- DynamoDB tables accessible with quest-dev-* naming
- Test user accounts (parent1@test.cmz.org, student1@test.cmz.org, etc.)
- Docker environment configured and running

### Test Scenarios Identified
- Function returns expected output for valid input
- Edge cases handled appropriately
- Error conditions raise proper exceptions
- Business logic follows specifications

### Success Criteria
- Functions produce expected outputs
- Edge cases handled without errors
- Business logic implemented correctly
- Code coverage meets project standards

### Risk Assessment
- **Low**: Standard development changes with minimal system impact

## Test Strategy
- **Primary Test Type**: Unit Test
- **Complexity**: High
- **Priority**: Normal
- **Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours (High complexity)

## Notes
