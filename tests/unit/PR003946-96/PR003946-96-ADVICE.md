# PR003946-96 - Test Specification Analysis

## Ticket Information
- **Ticket**: PR003946-96
- **Summary**: Integrated playwright testing
- **Type**: Task
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Test Category**: Unit

## Description
Create a suite of playwright tests that test all controls and buttons in the UI.  A report should be generated after the test outlining the successes and failures by high level feature.  It should also confirm that controls that should be hidden from user classes are users.  The tests should exercise changes in the dialog and ensure that the changes are persisted to the back end and can be retrieved and displayed where appropriate.  The test should be runnable from a gitlab pipeline as part of the .gitlab-ci quality gate.  You are free to propose and document a report structure,  but it needs to display the project health by test. Acceptance criteria: 1.  A list of all UI features and controls that is kept up to date when changes are made. 2.  Automated playwright tests for all the features in this list,  including testing boundary conditions. 3.  The test should run along with the backend,  the backend should be in the persistence test mode described by    4.  The test should produce a human readable report that represents the state of the project. 5.  The architecture should be proposed and documented before the implementation begins,  and saved in source control for the project. 6.  A slash claud command should be made to run these tests and display the output. 7.  This test structure should predefine all controls even if not implemented for TDD.  It should report the presence of the control as well as it’s functionality under stress input conditions.

## Technical Analysis

### Component Impact
- Core business logic

### Dependencies
- Backend services running on localhost:8080
- DynamoDB tables accessible with quest-dev-* naming
- Test user accounts (parent1@test.cmz.org, student1@test.cmz.org, etc.)
- Docker environment configured and running

### Test Scenarios Identified
- Function returns expected output for valid input
- Edge cases handled appropriately
- Error conditions raise proper exceptions
- Business logic follows specifications

### Success Criteria
- Functions produce expected outputs
- Edge cases handled without errors
- Business logic implemented correctly
- Code coverage meets project standards

### Risk Assessment
- **Low**: Standard development changes with minimal system impact

## Test Strategy
- **Primary Test Type**: Unit Test
- **Complexity**: Low
- **Priority**: Normal
- **Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours (Low complexity)

## Notes
- Generated on: 2025-09-13 16:51:38
- Based on systematic analysis of ticket content and CMZ project patterns
- Should be reviewed and refined based on implementation details
