# PR003946-105 - Test Specification Analysis

## Ticket Information
- **Ticket**: PR003946-105
- **Summary**: Secrets Management Integration
- **Type**: Task
- **Status**: To Do
- **Test Category**: Unit

## Description
**IMPORTANT: Use Sequential Reasoning MCP when implementing this ticket for systematic security analysis and planning.**Integrate secure secrets management with support for multiple backends including AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, and local development secrets.**Key Features:**- Multi-backend secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager, Vault, local)- Automatic secret rotation detection and reload- Secure credential caching with TTL expiration- Development environment support with local secrets**Technical Requirements:**- Encrypted secrets caching with memory protection- Fallback mechanisms for secret retrieval failures- Integration with environment configuration framework- Audit logging for all secret access operations**Implementation Approach:**- Use Sequential Reasoning MCP to analyze security requirements and threat models- Design fail-safe mechanisms for secret retrieval and caching- Implement comprehensive security testing and validation**Security Considerations:**- No plaintext secrets in logs or error messages- Secure memory handling for cached credentials- Proper cleanup of sensitive data structures- Compliance with security best practices**Acceptance Criteria:**1. Secrets are retrieved securely from configured backends2. Automatic rotation detection triggers credential refresh3. Fallback mechanisms handle backend failures gracefully4. All secret operations are properly audited and logged5. Development workflow supports local secrets without compromising security**Story Points:** 4 (Security-critical implementation with multiple integrations)

- Error conditions raise proper exceptions
- Business logic follows specifications

### Success Criteria
- Functions produce expected outputs
- Edge cases handled without errors
- Business logic implemented correctly
- Code coverage meets project standards

### Risk Assessment
- **Low**: Standard development changes with minimal system impact

## Test Strategy
- **Primary Test Type**: Unit Test
- **Complexity**: High
- **Priority**: Normal
- **Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours (High complexity)
