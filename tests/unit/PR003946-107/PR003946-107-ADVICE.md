# PR003946-107 - Test Specification Analysis

## Ticket Information
- **Ticket**: PR003946-107
- **Summary**: Environment-Specific Deployment Scripts
- **Type**: Task
- **Status**: To Do
- **Test Category**: Unit

## Description
**IMPORTANT: Use Sequential Reasoning MCP when implementing this ticket for systematic deployment analysis and automation.**Create automated deployment scripts that handle environment-specific configuration, secret management, and validation for consistent deployments across all environments.**Key Features:**- Environment-specific deployment automation- Pre-deployment configuration validation- Automated secret provisioning and rotation- Rollback mechanisms with configuration state management**Technical Requirements:**- Shell/Python scripts for deployment automation- Integration with configuration framework and secrets management- Pre-flight checks for environment readiness- Deployment status monitoring and reporting**Implementation Approach:**- Use Sequential Reasoning MCP to analyze deployment workflows and failure scenarios- Design fail-safe deployment processes with comprehensive rollback support- Implement systematic testing of deployment procedures**Deployment Phases:**1. Pre-deployment validation (configuration, secrets, dependencies)2. Configuration deployment with environment-specific overrides3. Secret provisioning and verification4. Application deployment with health checks5. Post-deployment validation and monitoring setup**Acceptance Criteria:**1. Deployment scripts handle all environment-specific requirements automatically2. Pre-deployment validation prevents invalid configurations from being deployed3. Secrets are provisioned securely during deployment process4. Rollback mechanisms can restore previous configuration state reliably5. Deployment status is monitored and reported throughout the process**Story Points:** 3 (Deployment automation with environment handling)

## Technical Analysis

### Component Impact
- Core business logic

### Dependencies
- Backend services running on localhost:8080
- DynamoDB tables accessible with quest-dev-* naming
- Test user accounts (parent1@test.cmz.org, student1@test.cmz.org, etc.)
- Docker environment configured and running

### Test Scenarios Identified
- Function returns expected output for valid input
- Edge cases handled appropriately
- Error conditions raise proper exceptions
- Business logic follows specifications

### Success Criteria
- Functions produce expected outputs
- Edge cases handled without errors
- Business logic implemented correctly
- Code coverage meets project standards

### Risk Assessment
- **Low**: Standard development changes with minimal system impact

## Test Strategy
- **Primary Test Type**: Unit Test
- **Complexity**: High
- **Priority**: Normal
- **Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours (High complexity)

## Notes
- Generated on: 2025-09-13 16:51:38
- Based on systematic analysis of ticket content and CMZ project patterns
- Should be reviewed and refined based on implementation details
