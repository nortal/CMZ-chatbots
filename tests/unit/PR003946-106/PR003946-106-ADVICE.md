# PR003946-106 - Test Specification Analysis

## Ticket Information
- **Ticket**: PR003946-106
- **Summary**: Configuration Validation System
- **Type**: Task
- **Status**: To Do
- **Test Category**: Unit

## Description
**IMPORTANT: Use Sequential Reasoning MCP when implementing this ticket for systematic validation design and testing.**Implement comprehensive validation system for all configuration sources with schema enforcement, constraint checking, and detailed error reporting.**Key Features:**- JSON Schema-based configuration validation- Custom validation rules for business logic- Cross-environment consistency checking- Detailed validation error reporting with suggestions**Technical Requirements:**- Schema-driven validation with versioning support- Performance-optimized validation for startup times- Integration with configuration framework and secrets management- Extensible validation rule system for custom constraints**Implementation Approach:**- Use Sequential Reasoning MCP to analyze validation requirements across all config types- Design comprehensive error reporting with actionable feedback- Implement systematic testing of all validation scenarios**Validation Categories:**- Structural validation (required fields, data types)- Business logic validation (ranges, relationships)- Security validation (credential formats, encryption requirements)- Environment consistency validation**Acceptance Criteria:**1. All configuration sources are validated against defined schemas2. Custom validation rules can be added for specific business requirements3. Validation errors provide clear, actionable feedback for resolution4. Cross-environment validation ensures consistency between environments5. Validation performance does not significantly impact startup time**Story Points:** 3 (Systematic validation implementation)

## Technical Analysis

### Component Impact
- Core business logic

### Dependencies
- Backend services running on localhost:8080
- DynamoDB tables accessible with quest-dev-* naming
- Test user accounts (parent1@test.cmz.org, student1@test.cmz.org, etc.)
- Docker environment configured and running

### Test Scenarios Identified
- Function returns expected output for valid input
- Edge cases handled appropriately
- Error conditions raise proper exceptions
- Business logic follows specifications

### Success Criteria
- Functions produce expected outputs
- Edge cases handled without errors
- Business logic implemented correctly
- Code coverage meets project standards

### Risk Assessment
- **Low**: Standard development changes with minimal system impact

## Test Strategy
- **Primary Test Type**: Unit Test
- **Complexity**: High
- **Priority**: Normal
- **Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours (High complexity)
