# PR003946-122 - Test Specification Analysis

## Ticket Information
- **Ticket**: PR003946-122
- **Summary**: Missing File Mode CRUD Operation Persistence Validation
- **Type**: Bug
- **Status**: To Do
- **Test Category**: Unit

## Description
CRITICAL BUG: No validation that file-based persistence correctly persists CRUD operations to JSON storage files. POST/PUT/DELETE may return HTTP 200 but not persist to files. Missing verification of JSON file updates, soft delete operations, concurrent operation safety. Impact: Data loss in development environments, inconsistent persistence behavior. Fix: Implement comprehensive file persistence validation verifying JSON storage files correctly updated after every CRUD operation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Acceptance criteria to be derived from summary and description

## Technical Analysis

### Component Impact
- Core business logic

### Dependencies

- Docker environment configured and running

### Test Scenarios Identified
- Function returns expected output for valid input
- Edge cases handled appropriately
- Error conditions raise proper exceptions
- Business logic follows specifications

### Success Criteria
- Functions produce expected outputs
- Edge cases handled without errors
- Business logic implemented correctly
- Code coverage meets project standards

### Risk Assessment
- **Low**: Standard development changes with minimal system impact

## Test Strategy
- **Primary Test Type**: Unit Test
- **Complexity**: Low
- **Priority**: Highest
- **Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours (Low complexity)
