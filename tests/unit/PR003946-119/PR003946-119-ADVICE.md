# PR003946-119 - Test Specification Analysis

## Ticket Information
- **Ticket**: PR003946-119
- **Summary**: Missing Test Report Generation Despite Successful Test Execution
- **Type**: Bug
- **Status**: To Do
- **Test Category**: Unit

## Description
CRITICAL BUG: Validation tests execute successfully (18/18 passed) but generate no reports in configured reports directory. Reports directory remains empty despite playwright.config.js configuration for HTML, JSON, and JUnit reports. Impact: No historical test records, missing CI/CD artifacts, debugging difficulty. Solution: Fix report generation, implement versioned report storage with timestamp directories, exclude from source control but preserve structure.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Acceptance criteria to be derived from summary and description

## Technical Analysis
