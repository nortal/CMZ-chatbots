# PR003946-99 - Test Specification Analysis

## Ticket Information
- **Ticket**: PR003946-99
- **Summary**: Comprehensive backend integration test
- **Type**: Task
- **Status**: To Do
- **Test Category**: Unit

## Description
Using curl or another HTTP request tool,  created a comprehensive integration test for the backend while connected to DynamoDB.  It should test all endpoints in the OpenAPI spec and try failure scenarios and things like trying to post a new data element with it’s ID already specified.  It is critical that the test cleans up after itself in the database.  A test report should be created showing the status of passed and failed tests and a summary graph.  This should include all endpoints and verbs so that it can be used as TDD.   Soft deletes are not acceptable,  elements created in the test must be fully deleted and all other elements returned to their pre-test state. Acceptance Criteria: 1.  Thoroughly tests all endpoints and verbs in the project with multiple values 2.  Create a human readable report on what was tested and what passed and failed 3.  The test suite should be easily updated either by AI or another mechanism when the OpenAI document changes 4.  At the end of the test the suite must return the persistent storage to its original state.

## Technical Analysis

### Component Impact
- Core business logic

### Dependencies
- Backend services running on localhost:8080
- DynamoDB tables accessible with quest-dev-* naming
- Test user accounts (parent1@test.cmz.org, student1@test.cmz.org, etc.)
- Docker environment configured and running

### Test Scenarios Identified
- Function returns expected output for valid input
- Edge cases handled appropriately
- Error conditions raise proper exceptions
- Business logic follows specifications

### Success Criteria
- Functions produce expected outputs
- Edge cases handled without errors
- Business logic implemented correctly
- Code coverage meets project standards

### Risk Assessment
- **Low**: Standard development changes with minimal system impact

## Test Strategy
- **Primary Test Type**: Unit Test
- **Complexity**: High
- **Priority**: Normal
- **Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours (High complexity)

## Notes
- Generated on: 2025-09-13 16:51:38
- Based on systematic analysis of ticket content and CMZ project patterns
- Should be reviewed and refined based on implementation details
