# PR003946-108 - Test Specification Analysis

## Ticket Information
- **Ticket**: PR003946-108
- **Summary**: Configuration Monitoring and Alerting
- **Type**: Task
- **Status**: To Do
- **Test Category**: Unit

## Description
**IMPORTANT: Use Sequential Reasoning MCP when implementing this ticket for systematic monitoring design and alerting strategy.**Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting for configuration changes, secret rotations, and system health related to environment configuration management.**Key Features:**- Real-time configuration change monitoring- Secret rotation and expiration alerting- Configuration drift detection between environments- Health checks for configuration system components**Technical Requirements:**- Integration with existing monitoring infrastructure- Configurable alert thresholds and escalation policies- Dashboard for configuration system health visibility- Automated remediation for common configuration issues**Implementation Approach:**- Use Sequential Reasoning MCP to analyze monitoring requirements and failure modes- Design comprehensive alerting strategy with appropriate escalation- Implement systematic testing of monitoring and alerting systems**Monitoring Categories:**- Configuration Changes: Track all modifications with attribution- Secret Health: Monitor rotation status and expiration warnings- System Performance: Track configuration loading times and caching efficiency- Environment Consistency: Alert on configuration drift between environments**Acceptance Criteria:**1. All configuration changes are monitored and logged with proper attribution2. Secret rotation and expiration events trigger appropriate alerts3. Configuration drift between environments is detected and reported4. System health monitoring provides visibility into configuration framework performance5. Automated remediation handles common configuration issues without manual intervention**Story Points:** 3 (Monitoring and alerting system implementation)

- Error conditions raise proper exceptions
- Business logic follows specifications

### Success Criteria
- Functions produce expected outputs
- Edge cases handled without errors
- Business logic implemented correctly
- Code coverage meets project standards

### Risk Assessment
- **Low**: Standard development changes with minimal system impact

## Test Strategy
- **Primary Test Type**: Unit Test
- **Complexity**: High
- **Priority**: Normal
- **Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours (High complexity)
