# PR003946-109 - Test Specification Analysis

## Ticket Information
- **Ticket**: PR003946-109
- **Summary**: Configuration Security Audit Tools
- **Type**: Task
- **Status**: To Do
- **Test Category**: Security

## Description
**IMPORTANT: Use Sequential Reasoning MCP when implementing this ticket for systematic security analysis and audit design.**Develop comprehensive security audit tools for configuration management, including secret scanning, permission auditing, and compliance reporting.**Key Features:**- Automated secret scanning in configuration files- Permission and access control auditing- Compliance reporting for security standards- Security best practices validation**Technical Requirements:**- Integration with existing security tools and workflows- Automated scanning for hardcoded secrets and credentials- Role-based access control validation- Compliance reporting for SOC2, PCI-DSS, and other standards**Implementation Approach:**- Use Sequential Reasoning MCP to analyze security requirements and compliance needs- Design comprehensive audit framework with automated reporting- Implement systematic security testing and validation**Audit Categories:**- Secret Management: Scan for hardcoded secrets, validate rotation policies- Access Control: Audit permissions and role assignments- Configuration Security: Validate encryption, secure defaults, and security configurations- Compliance: Generate reports for security standards and regulations**Security Standards Coverage:**- OWASP security best practices- SOC2 compliance requirements- Industry-specific regulations (PCI-DSS, HIPAA as applicable)- Internal security policies and standards**Acceptance Criteria:**1. Automated secret scanning detects hardcoded credentials in all configuration sources2. Permission auditing validates proper access controls are in place3. Compliance reporting generates required documentation for security standards4. Security validation ensures configuration follows established best practices5. Audit tools integrate with existing security workflows and CI/CD processes**Story Points:** 3 (Security audit tooling and compliance)

## Technical Analysis

### Component Impact
- Core business logic

### Dependencies
- Backend services running on localhost:8080
- DynamoDB tables accessible with quest-dev-* naming
- Test user accounts (parent1@test.cmz.org, student1@test.cmz.org, etc.)
- Docker environment configured and running

### Test Scenarios Identified
- Authentication mechanisms work correctly
- Authorization prevents unauthorized access
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- Session management functions properly

### Success Criteria
- Authentication mechanisms prevent unauthorized access
- Input validation blocks malicious content
- Session management maintains security
- Authorization checks enforce role-based permissions

### Risk Assessment
- **Low**: Standard development changes with minimal system impact

## Test Strategy
- **Primary Test Type**: Security Test
- **Complexity**: High
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 3-5 hours (High complexity)
