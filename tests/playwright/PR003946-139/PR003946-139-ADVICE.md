# PR003946-139 - Test Specification Analysis

## Ticket Information
- **Ticket**: PR003946-139
- **Summary**: Implement Automated Build Versioning and Validation Pre-checks
- **Type**: Task
- **Status**: To Do
- **Test Category**: Playwright

## Description
Problem Statement Currently, the CMZ chatbot platform lacks build versioning, making it difficult to verify that validation testing is performed against the latest code changes. This creates validation confidence issues and debugging challenges when integration issues occur. Business Impact Validation Reliability: Cannot confirm services are running current code before integration testing Debugging Efficiency: No traceable build identifiers when investigating issues Development Workflow: Manual verification required to ensure code changes are deployed Production Readiness: Missing version tracking for deployment verification Acceptance Criteria AC1: Automated Build Number Generation Generate unique build numbers during make build-api command Build number format: YYYYMMDD-HHMM-{git-short-hash} (e.g., 20250913-2130-a1b2c3d) Build number stored in environment variables during build process Build number embedded in Docker container labels and environment AC2: Backend Version Integration Create /system_health endpoint that includes build version information Version information includes: buildNumber, gitCommit, buildTimestamp, environment Version accessible via environment variable in running container AC3: Frontend Version Integration Build number injected into React app during build process Version accessible in browser console or developer tools Frontend displays version in footer or about section AC4: Validation Pre-check Integration Update validation command to check versions first Pre-validation step queries both services for build numbers Clear error messages when build versions indicate stale code

## Acceptance Criteria
- AC1: Automated Build Number Generation Generate unique build numbers during make build-api command Build number format: YYYYMMDD-HHMM-{git-short-hash} (e.g., 20250913-2130-a1b2c3d) Build number stored in environment variables during build process Build number embedded in Docker container labels and environment AC2: Backend Version Integration Create /system_health endpoint that includes build version information Version information includes: buildNumber, gitCommit, buildTimestamp, environment Version accessible via environment variable in running container AC3: Frontend Version Integration Build number injected into React app during build process Version accessible in browser console or developer tools Frontend displays version in footer or about section AC4: Validation Pre-check Integration Update validation command to check versions first Pre-validation step queries both services for build numbers Clear error messages when build versions indicate stale code

## Technical Analysis

### Component Impact
- Frontend React application

### Dependencies
- Backend services running on localhost:8080
- DynamoDB tables accessible with quest-dev-* naming
- Test user accounts (parent1@test.cmz.org, student1@test.cmz.org, etc.)
- Docker environment configured and running
- Frontend services running on localhost:3001
- Browser compatibility testing environment

### Test Scenarios Identified
- UI elements render correctly across browsers
- User interactions trigger expected behaviors
- Form submissions work with valid/invalid data
- Error messages display appropriately

### Success Criteria
- UI functions correctly across target browsers
- User workflows complete successfully
- Responsive design works on different screen sizes
- Accessibility requirements met

### Risk Assessment
- **Low**: Standard development changes with minimal system impact

## Test Strategy
- **Primary Test Type**: Playwright Test
- **Complexity**: High
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours (High complexity)

## Notes
- Generated on: 2025-09-13 16:51:38
- Based on systematic analysis of ticket content and CMZ project patterns
- Should be reviewed and refined based on implementation details
