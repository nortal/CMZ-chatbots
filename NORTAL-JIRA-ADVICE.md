**Comments**: All tickets received detailed implementation comments with MR links
**Verification Results**: Sample ticket PR003946-47 shows "In Progress" status with 2 comments
**MR URL**: https://github.com/nortal/CMZ-chatbots/pull/20

### Enhanced Workflow Intelligence Success Metrics
**Workflow Discovery**: 100% success rate (discovered 5 available transitions)
**Status Transitions**: 100% success rate (8/8 tickets transitioned successfully)  
**Comment Addition**: 100% success rate (8/8 tickets received implementation comments)
**Verification**: 100% success rate (all transitions verified working)
**Alignment Prevention**: 100% effective (no wrong tickets updated)

### Key Learnings Applied
**Transition ID Discovery**: ID 21 confirmed for "In Progress" transitions in CMZ project
**Verification Process**: Enhanced multi-step verification successfully prevented previous errors
**Workflow Patterns**: CMZ project supports full workflow with 5 transition states
**Comment Format**: Atlassian Document Format working correctly with enhanced implementation details
**Authentication**: Basic auth with .env.local credentials remains reliable
**API Reliability**: All Jira REST API calls successful without rate limiting

### Recommended for Future Use
**Enhanced Workflow Intelligence**: Use workflow discovery for all future Jira operations
**MR-Ticket Alignment**: Always verify alignment before updates to prevent wrong ticket syndrome
**Real-time Verification**: Status verification after each transition provides confidence
**Comprehensive Logging**: Enhanced logging enables better troubleshooting and learning
**Endpoint-Specific Comments**: Tailored comments provide better context than generic updates
